# automatic pacman-Playing-Agent

Designed an agent that can play the game of Pac-man automatically i.e. taking the best possible decision at every instance of game.\
The game involves a Pac-man that tries to eat as many food pellets as possible.\ 
There are walls present in the environment that cannot be crossed by any agent.\
The Pacman must plan its actions avoiding ghosts that are moving in the environment.\ 
Modeled the decision-making task as an adversarial search problem that allows the Pacman to decide actions while taking into account the behaviour of ghosts.\
Implemented another agent, Minimax agent, using the main agent, to play in a situation where there are alternate chance making decision against the ghost adversory.\
Implemented different solution technique like, alpha-beta pruning, expectimax, to efficiently explore the minimax tree of decisions.
